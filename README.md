## Date Night - Project One

## Description

As a group we decided to build an app that helps a nervous person to schedule his date and get a direction, 

knows the weather on that date, clothes, drinks, joke and quote suggestions.

 Steps that have been done to get the result:

* Identify real world problem to address.

* Drawing a flow chart to break down the code.

* Listing all the APIs we need for the App.

* Splitting tasks for each contributor to do.

* Discussing the results and debugging the code together.

## User Story

```
AS A nervous person
I WANT help with confidence when going on a date
SO THAT I can have a successful date
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a website to help me
WHEN I enter a location
THEN the website will provide me with the weather for the location of the date, directions to the location, time taken to get there and a playlist of that length
WHEN the weather is presented
THEN clothing suggestions are made
WHEN I realise I'm nervous about what to say
THEN the site offers a joke, quote, and drinks suggestions
WHEN the date is over
THEN the website asks if it went well
WHEN I respond with yes or no,
THEN a comedic response is given.
```
