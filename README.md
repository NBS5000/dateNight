### ⭐ ⭐ S.T.A.R. ⭐ ⭐

**SITUATION**

As agroup we decided to build an app that helps a nervous person to schadule his date and get adirection, 

knows the weather on that date, clothes, drinks, joke and quot sugestions.

The premise behind the app

The provided user story was: 

> <span style="font-style:italic">AS A nervous person,</span>
> 
> <span style="font-style:italic">I WANT help with going on a date</span>
>
> <span style="font-style:italic">SO THAT I can feel confident and be successful</span>

**TASK**

how we designed the app to meet the user needs and how it will meet the user needs

**ACTION**

Writing of a solution to resolve the situation, including:
* Layout
  * *Layout is responsive and functional on various screen sizes*
  * *Simple, yet attractive design*
  * *Logical layout*
  * *Improved code visualisation - eg: indentation*
  * *Error free loading*
  * *Favicon designed and added*
  * *Thorough comments*
  * *Intuitive design with messages to users*
* Javascript
  * *Error free performance*
  * *Multiple functions to separate aspects of code*
  * *Thorough comments*
* API's connected to throughout the app:
  * Moment.js - for time handling
  * 
* GIT
  * *Numerous commits to track changes in code*
  * *Code added to public repository and Github Pages for public viewing*
* Functionality
  * something here

**RESULT**

The end code is stored on Github, and publicly available and viewable. This result meets all requirements of the User Story and acceptance criteria:

* GIVEN a website to help me
* WHEN I enter a location
* THEN the website will provide me with the weather for the location of the date, directions to the location, time taken to get there and a playlist of that length
* WHEN the weather is presented
* THEN clothing suggestions are made
* WHEN I realise I'm nervous about what to say
* THEN the site offers a joke, quote, and drinks suggestions
* WHEN the date is over
* THEN the website asks if it went well
* WHEN I respond with yes or no,
* THEN suggestions are made (yes offers events to watch for next date & wedding rings, no offers 'this person doesn't exist / foaas')
