## <span style="color:green"> The Task</span>

The task was to create a solution that asks the users questions, records their score and lists a set of hgh scores, with a timer that ends the quiz when it runs out.

### ⭐ ⭐ S.T.A.R. ⭐ ⭐

**SITUATION**

The provided user story was: 

> <span style="font-style:italic">AS A coding boot camp student</span>
> 
> <span style="font-style:italic">I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores</span>
>
> <span style="font-style:italic">SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers</span>

**TASK**

Provide a solution that asks a number of questions, against a timer, and then record the score and compare to other scores.

*Having checked with the teachers, it was confirmed that the topic of questions does not necessarily need to be on Javascript*

**ACTION**

Writing of a solution to resolve the situation, including:
* Layout
  * *Layout is responsive and functional on various screen sizes*
  * *Simple, yet attractive design*
  * *Logical layout*
  * *Improved code visualisation - eg: indentation*
  * *Error free loading*
  * *Favicon designed and added*
  * *Thorough comments*
  * *Intuitive design with messages to users*
* Javascript
  * *Error free performance*
  * *Multiple functions to separate aspects of code*
  * *Thorough comments*
* GIT
  * *Numerous commits to track changes in code*
  * *Code added to public repository and Github Pages for public viewing*
* Functionality
  * *Feedback to the user as to how well they've done, with a Star Wars twist*
  * *Hall of Fame to track the best scores, which can be cleared if desired*

**RESULT**

The end code is stored on Github, and publicly available and viewable. This result meets all requirements of the User Story and acceptance criteria:

* ~~GIVEN I am taking a code quiz~~
* ~~WHEN I click the start button~~
* ~~THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question~~
* ~~WHEN I answer a question~~
* ~~THEN I am presented with another question~~
* ~~WHEN I answer a question incorrectly~~
* ~~THEN time is subtracted from the clock~~
* ~~WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0~~
* ~~THEN the game is over~~
* ~~WHEN the game is over~~
* ~~THEN I can save my initials and my score~~

## <span style="color:green"> The Outcome</span>

As the acceptance criteria has been met and exceeded, the task is now complete. 

*As a caveat, I checked with the teachers to confirm if the topic of questions had to be Javascript related, and they confirmed it did not.*
