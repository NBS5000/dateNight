* WHEN the weather is presented
* THEN clothing suggestions are made
* WHEN I realise I'm nervous about what to say
* THEN the site offers a joke, quote, and drinks suggestions

* THEN suggestions are made (yes offers events to watch for next date & wedding rings, no offers 'this person doesn't exist / foaas')
